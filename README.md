# Use
**This application requires processing 2.2.x**
Simply unzip the downloaded file inside your sketchbook folder, open and then Sketch→Present.

# Modifying the simulatation
Inside the sketch folder (to see the sketch folder do Sketch→Show sketch folder) you'll find a folder called `helioroom_resources` and, inside such folder a file called, `config.json`. This file describes the parameters of the simulation. Change these parameters only if you know what you are doing.
